# Project History: RAGS

This document provides a chronological history of major changes and improvements made to the RAGS project.

## Initial Setup and Enhancements

1. **Project Creation**
   - Generated using the fpgmaas/cookiecutter-uv template
   - Basic Python project structure created with src/rags package

2. **Python Version Update**
   - Updated Python version from 3.11 to 3.12 in dev container
   - Modified `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to use Python 3.12 image

3. **SSH Authentication Setup**
   - Added SSH key forwarding to dev container
   - Configured Git integration in container environment
   - Added mount points for .ssh directory from host to container
   - Set up SSH agent socket forwarding

4. **Cursor Rules Creation**
   - Created `.cursor/rules/` directory for development guidance
   - Added the following rules:
     - **project-structure.mdc**: Overview of code organization
     - **development-workflow.mdc**: Standards for development processes
     - **code-standards.mdc**: Code quality and style guidelines
     - **getting-started.mdc**: Setup process from README
     - **environment-setup.mdc**: Python version guidance
     - **package-management.mdc**: Instructions for using uv over pip
     - **devcontainer-setup.mdc**: SSH configuration instructions

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Separated cookiecutter setup instructions into COOKIECUTTER_SETUP.md
   - Updated README.md with project-specific content
   - Added details about SSH configuration and Cursor rules
   - Fixed formatting issues in various files

6. **Version Management**
   - Added uv.lock file to version control
   - Created tag v0.0.2 for Python 3.12 and SSH configuration update
   - Pushed changes to GitHub

7. **Configuration Fixes**
   - Fixed duplicate features key in devcontainer.json
   - Ensured proper SSH key forwarding setup

## Current State

The project now has:
- Modern Python 3.12 environment
- Secure SSH key forwarding for Git operations
- Comprehensive documentation and development guidelines
- Properly structured package with type checking
- Configured CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- Detailed Cursor rules for consistent development

This project demonstrates good practices for Python development with modern tooling, emphasizing the use of uv for package management and leveraging dev containers for consistent environments.
