# Development Workflow

This project is a cookiecutter uv project. ALWAYS use uv instead of pip for all dependency management operations.

## Setup

- Use `uv` for virtual environment and dependency management
- Install the environment with: `make install`
- For any package operations use `uv` commands, not pip (e.g., `uv add package` instead of `pip install package`)

## Development Tools

- Code quality tools are run with: `make check`
  - Pre-commit hooks: [.pre-commit-config.yaml](mdc:.pre-commit-config.yaml)
  - Type checking with mypy as configured in [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml)
  - Linting with ruff as configured in [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml)
  - Dependency checking with deptry

## Testing

- Run tests with: `make test`
- Tests use pytest with coverage reporting
- Test configuration in [tox.ini](mdc:tox.ini) and [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml)

## Documentation

- Build and serve documentation with: `make docs`
- Documentation is configured in [mkdocs.yml](mdc:mkdocs.yml)

## Build and Publish

- Build package with: `make build`
- Publish to PyPI with: `make publish`

See the [Makefile](mdc:Makefile) for all available commands.
