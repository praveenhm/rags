# Dev Container Setup

## SSH Authentication for All Projects

When creating a new project with a dev container, copy the entire SSH configuration section from the current project's [.devcontainer/devcontainer.json](mdc:.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) (look for the section between `BEGIN SSH CONFIGURATION` and `END SSH CONFIGURATION` comments).

### What Each Part Does

1. **SSH Key Mounting**: Makes your local SSH keys available in the container
2. **SSH Agent Forwarding**: Allows the container to use your host's SSH agent for authentication
3. **Git Features**: Ensures Git is properly installed with latest version

### How to Use

1. In any new project, create a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file
2. Copy the SSH configuration section from the existing project's devcontainer.json file
3. Ensure it's properly integrated with other settings (i.e., no duplicate keys)
4. Rebuild the container to apply changes

## Python Version

For Python projects:
- Always use Python 3.12 or newer: `"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:1-3.12-bullseye"`
